					<h4>Weekly Update #2</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>4/29/2015</strong><br />
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing another interview and some mild usability testing with our rough digital mockup, our team is on track to meet our milestones as planned. Originally, we had expected to conduct some participatory design sessions by this milestone, however after last week's check in we decided to remove them from the plan. Scheduling a design session with multiple teachers at once was not feasible; all of our contacts are teachers at different schools in different parts of town with varied schedules. Also, since no one on our team has Android development experience we decided to switch platforms to build a web app instead of a mobile app. We will be using Ruby on Rails and hosting the app on Heroku. With these changes we are on track to meet our second and third milestones.
					</p>
					<p>
						This <a href="docs/milestone1.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck</a> contains more detail about our status.

					<h4>Weekly Update #1</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>4/21/2015</strong><br />
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							3 done:
							<ul>
								<li><span>met with professor from College of Edu</span></li>
								<li><span>sent emails out to ~10 people about participatory design / future usability testing</span></li>
								<li><span>submitted application to EEU to interview a teacher</span></li>
								<li><span>met with teacher from cleveland high</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							3 will do:
							<ul>
								<li><span>find elementary teachers</span></li>
								<li><span>schedule and carry out participatory design sessions</span></li>
								<li><span>make a skeletal paper prototype or mockup</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							3 blocker:
							<ul>
								<li><span>waiting for email responses</span></li>
								<li><span>can't move too far in a mockup until participatory design sessions done</span></li>
								<li><span>need to talk with an elementary school teacher</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In summary, we need to do more interviews with teachers, especially at the elementary level of education, in order to decide whether rescoping to a K-6 age group is the right choice to address the difference between age groups. In making a mockup we can at best estimate what choice we might make and then later likely have to change many things to fit with the answers we discover. We are in contact with lots of people, but to our knowledge not anyone who teaches at grade levels 1 though 5.

					<h4>Design Mockups</h4>
					<p>
						In drafting and iterating upon our design we created a digital mockup using the tool Justinmind. It is interactive in our most important tasks so that usability testing can be conducted as we continue to improve IEP Collect. The app is design for tablets, to be used by a teacher anywhere in the classroom. Below is an HTML rendering of the most recent state mockup. Some areas of the screens are interactive, but not all. Navigation throughout the various screens is incomplete in this form.

					<h4>Prototype</h4>
					<p>
						Our design is meant to be used via a tablet app, that can also be accessed using a browser interface for some tasks. For the purposes of time and the backgrounds of our team members, our high fidelity prototype is built as a Ruby on Rails app and hosted on Heroku.

					<h3>The Project</h2>
					<p>
						Our design is a tablet application for assisting daily data collection. General and special education teachers track information pretaining to the goals and accomodations specified by the students' IEPs. You can see previous research in this area, that we are building on, <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/iepconnect/">here</a>.
