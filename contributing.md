title: General Development Guide
---

This page documents some of our development tools and conventions. It aims to be thorough as possible while
remaining generic. Individual projects then document their own installation and configuration details.

We provide detailed instructions for [Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#Windows) and [Mac OSX]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#OSX). If you're on another operating system (e.g. Unix), you probably don't need help setting this up. Take a look at the [OSX instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#OSX) for some basic ideas.

Once you're set up, we provide additional instructions for [forking the repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#forking), [branching behavior]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#branches), and [submitting a pull request]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#pull_request).

## <a name="Windows"></a> Windows Setup Instructions

### <a name="Git"></a> Git and GitHub

We use Git and GitHub.

First, download [git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win).

Consider downloading [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), which provides a graphical interface for interacting with git and GitHub.

By convention, GitHub for Windows defines the `upstream` remote:

    git remote add upstream <GitHub HTTPS clone URL>

For example, for [cse440-au14](https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-au14) we define `upstream` as:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-au14.git

This ends up being a very useful convention, regardless of whether you're on Windows, Mac, Linux, or something we've never heard of.

### <a name="Jekyll_win"></a> Jekyll

We use Jekyll to build our websites. It requires Python 2.7 and Ruby.

First, [install Python 2.7]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#Python27_win).

Second, [install Ruby]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#Ruby_win).

Now we can install Jekyll:

    gem install jekyll

By convention, we use Fabric to ease deployment. It should be installed as part of `requirements2.txt`.

The `build` task will compile the site to `_site`.

    fab build

The `serve` task will continuously compile and serve the website on `localhost:4000`.

    fab serve

The `deploy` task will deploy the site to its production location.

    fab deploy

### <a name="MicrosoftVisualStudio"></a> Microsoft Visual Studio

Many Node.js and Python modules require a C compiler for included native code.

We currently use the freely available Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 for Windows Desktop:

<http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9816758>

#### Versions

Node.js and Python each expect particular versions of Microsoft Visual Studio. Currently, that expectation is:

  * Node.js: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012
  * Python 3.4: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010
  * Python 2.7: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2008

Each version defines environment variables that say where to find the build tools:

  * `VS110COMNTOOLS` is defined by Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012
  * `VS100COMNTOOLS` is defined by Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010
  * `VS90COMNTOOLS` is defined by Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2008

Instead of installing all of these versions, we manipulate the environment variables to alias the old versions to the newer version. This is not necessarily 100% robust, but has not been problematic.

This can be done locally within a session:

    set VS90COMNTOOLS="%VS110COMNTOOLS%"
    set VS100COMNTOOLS="%VS110COMNTOOLS%"

Alternatively, we can define the system environment variable:

     Control Panel
     System and Security
     System
     Advanced system settings
     Environment Variables...
     System variables
     New...

![VS90COMNTOOLS]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/vs90comntools.png)
![VS100COMNTOOLS]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/vs100comntools.png)

### <a name="Node.js_win"></a> Node.js

When I first tried to install Node.js, a tree fell on my house. Seriously. So first check you are not under any trees.

First, [install Microsoft Visual Studio]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#MicrosoftVisualStudio).

You then need Node.js:

<http://nodejs.org/download/>

Unfortunately, the current installers seem to require a reboot for path settings to take effect.

You should then be sure to understand the difference between global and local modules:

<http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/>

Following the advice "install it in both places", we install several modules globally. These each have commands that it is convenient to be able to easily execute.

Cordova/PhoneGap enables mobile applications based on HTML, CSS, and Javascript:

    npm -g install cordova
    npm -g install phonegap

Ionic works with Cordova/PhoneGap and Angular to target mobile apps:

    npm -g install ionic

And you should install a project's local dependencies:

    npm install

### <a name="Python27_win"></a> Python 2.7

We use Python 2.7 as little as possible, but there are still libraries that require it.

First, [install Microsoft Visual Studio]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#MicrosoftVisualStudio). Be sure to note the need to configure environment variables to point Python 2.7 at the install.

You then need Python:

<https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6.msi>

Python 2.7 does not come with a built-in package manager, so we need to install it. Download these two files:

<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py>

<https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>

Then you can install pip:

    c:\Python27\python ez_setup.py
    c:\Python27\python get-pip.py

Now you need virtualenv:

    c:\Python27\Scripts\pip install virtualenv

Finally you can create a Python environment for your project. By convention, we call our environment `env27`:

    c:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe env27

Now you can install your project requirements. By convention, we put these in `requirements2.txt`:

    env27\Scripts\activate.bat
    pip install -r requirements2.txt

If a module fails with an error `Unable to find vcvarsall.bat`, it is because Microsoft Visual Studio is not set up correctly.

### <a name="Python34_win"></a> Python 3.4

We should use Python 3 whenever possible. Currently that means Python 3.4.

First, [install Microsoft Visual Studio]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html#MicrosoftVisualStudio). Be sure to note the need to configure environment variables to point Python 3.4 at the install.

You then need Python:

<https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/python-3.4.1.msi>

Python 3.4 includes pip and pyvenv, so we just get started. By convention, we call our environment `env34`:

    c:\Python34\python.exe -m venv env34    

Now you can install your project requirements. By convention, we put these in `requirements3.txt`:

    env34\Scripts\activate.bat
    pip install -r requirements3.txt

If a module fails with an error `Unable to find vcvarsall.bat`, it is because Microsoft Visual Studio is not set up correctly.

### <a name="Ruby_win"></a> Ruby

To install Ruby, you need Ruby and an associated DevKit. You can get them here:

<http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/>

Per the recommendations of the Ruby folks, I am using the 1.93 versions. First install Ruby:

<http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-1.9.3-p545.exe?direct>

During the install:

  * I use the install path `c:\Ruby193`
  * Ensure Checked "Add Ruby executables to your PATH"

Then install the Ruby DevKit:

<https://github.com/downloads/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-tdm-32-4.5.2-20111229-1559-sfx.exe>

Unzip it to a permanent directory. I use `c:\RubyDevKit`. Then install the DevKit:

    cd c:\RubyDevKit
    ruby dk.rb init
    ruby dk.rb install

## <a name="OSX"></a> Mac OSX Setup Instructions

### <a name="Git"></a> Git and GitHub

We use Git and GitHub.

First, download [git for Mac](http://git-scm.com/download/mac).

Consider downloading [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/), which provides a graphical interface for interacting with git and GitHub.

By convention, GitHub for Windows defines the `upstream` remote:

    git remote add upstream <GitHub HTTPS clone URL>

For example, for [cse440-au14](https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-au14) we define `upstream` as:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-au14.git

This ends up being a very useful convention, regardless of whether you're on Windows, Mac, Linux, or something we've never heard of.

### <a name="Jekyll_osx"></a> Jekyll

We use Jekyll to build our websites. It requires Python 2.7 and Ruby.

The easiest way to install Jekyll on Mac is to first install [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download). Once you do this, setting up Jekyll becomes simple.

    gem install jekyll

If you run into problems with this, you might need to install OSX Command Line Tools. Directions for doing so are available [here](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html).

It's that easy (note how much shorter the directions are than the Windows ones!). By default, the above command will install all other dependencies.

By convention, we use Fabric to ease deployment. It should be installed as part of `requirements2.txt`.

The `build` task will compile the site to `_site`.

    fab build

The `serve` task will continuously compile and serve the website on `localhost:4000`.

    fab serve

The `deploy` task will deploy the site to its production location.

    fab deploy

## <a name="forking"></a> Forking the Repository

The easiest way to fork a repository is to visit the repository on GitHub and press the fork button. So for our course repository, visit [here](https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-au14).

![fork]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/fork.png)

And then you have a local version!

![forked]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/forked.png)

You can then clone it on your desktop and start editing.

![cloned]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/cloned.png)

You can also clone it via the desktop application. For example, on Mac:

![cloning_desktop]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/cloning_desktop.png)
    
## <a name="branches"></a>Branching Behavior

All of the directions in this section assume that you're using a command line. If you decided to use Git for Windows or Git for Mac, you'll need to navigate the user interface to do the same activities, but it should be fairly straightforward.

Git operates with an idea called _branches_. These are incredibly useful for keeping your code separate whenever possible. When you're working, create a separate branch for your code. For example, if I were making a branch to edit assignment 3, I might do the following:

	git checkout -b assignment3

Which checks out a new branch named `assignment3`. If you ever want to switch branches, you can check out a new branch. Such as: `git checkout master`.

You might also be able to achieve this via the desktop application. For example, on Mac:

![branching_desktop]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/branching_desktop.png)

Congrats! You now have your branch. You can now make whatever changes you need to _within that directory_.

To commit code, you first need to `add` your files with `git add`. For example, if I edited the `index.html` file, I would type:

	git add index.html
	
I can then `git commit` my work and add a message. However, this only commits the files _locally_; meaning they will only appear on my computer, but not to the rest of the internet! To resolve this, we `push` our code after committing:

	git push

This is usually pretty apparent via the desktop applications. Files usually are automatically checked to be added by default in the desktop applications.

## <a name="pull_request"></a> Submitting a Pull Request

After pushing a set of changes, a pull request appears in the parent repository (the [course website repository](https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-au14) in our case). It'll look something like the following:

![pull_request]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/development_general/pull_request.png)

Push the `pull request` button and send one off to us! We'll take a look, and accept your changes if they don't crash the website.
