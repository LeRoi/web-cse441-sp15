## Course Description

Students will work in groups of three or four on a single project that parallels the experience of delivering a high-fidelity interactive prototype within a company or with a customer.

Students are expected to already possess knowledge of appropriate HCI methods, and will focus on independently applying those methods in their work.
There will therefore be little or no lecture material in this course.
Course staff will instead work closely with students to critique and advise on their group project.

Prerequisite: CSE 440 or instructor's permission.

## Project Scope

Students will propose, design, and develop a high-fidelity interactive prototype.
The definition of "high-fidelity interactive prototype" will be negotiated with each group according to the nature of their project.
For example, a group delivering a mobile application or website will be expected to provide a complete interactive experience.
But the prototype of that experience might be unlikely to scale in a large deployment, or might be limited in some other regard.

Project process will include:

- An initial pitch by pairs of students.
- A group formation and bidding process.
- Project proposal, including group definition of major milestones.
- Peer and staff evaluation at milestones.
- Final project poster, report, and demo.

It is appropriate, but not required, to choose to pitch proposals based on prior CSE 440 projects:

- [Winter 2015 CSE 440 Projects](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/15wi/projects.html)
- [Winter 2014 CSE 440 Projects](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au#quarter-projects)

We welcome proposals based on any idea that has previously been explored and developed at a similar level of depth.
But the demands of this course are too high for starting from scratch.
You need an initial high-quality understanding of your problem and directions for your design.

## Project Communication and Documentation

The overall structure of the course is intended to facilitate rapid feedback on project progress:

- Tuesday class will include an update from each project group to the full class.
  This will be either a presentation (i.e., at milestones) or a more casual stand-up (i.e., weekly update).
- Individual project meetings will be organized on Thursday, primarily during the scheduled section.
- Students will document their process and progress on project websites, including weekly updates.
- Students will prepare a final poster, report, and presentation/demo.

## Grading

Grading will be based on the project process and individual contributions to that process:

- Project scope (e.g., setting sufficiently ambitious milestones).
- Project results (e.g., achieving milestones, employing appropriate methods to yield good results, deliverables).
- Project commitment (e.g., appropriate weekly reports, high effort, peer evaluation).

These three criteria will be weighted approximately equally.

Your grade will thus reflect project work as evaluated by the staff, fellow students, and any mentor.
Feedback will be provided throughout the class, such that groups and individuals understand their performance.
If any problems emerge with group dynamics, it is the student responsibility to notify staff as soon as possible.
